<summary>Difference between let, const and var?</summary>

 Firstly we will look about the difference between **let**, **const**. **let** & **const** both keywords are used to declare a variable.

 **const**: So when we declare variable using const keyword let's say `const a;` so at that time of decleration and initialization is compulsary. `const a = 20;` later we can not change the value of const declare variable.

 **let**: On the other hand when we declare variable using let keyword, we can declare it first, then later we can assign the value. We can do both things at the same time declaring and assigning & we can change the value of variable that are declare using let keyword. 

 **var**: So var is completly different as compare to this two keyword `let` & `const`, & it is not recommended to use var keyword the reason is we can redeclared it and reinitialized. So var is similar to let assigning multiple values is allowed but dangerous characteristic is we redeclare the variables which ar created using **var** keyword.
