2. `Create a JavaScript file` : For example, let's create a file named `index.js` and open it in any text editor like Visual Studio Code or Sublime and write some code e.g

```js
console.log("Hello World!");
```

3. `Open Terminal` : Open your system’s terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your JavaScript file is located. You can use the `cd` command to change directories.

4. ` Run the File` : Once you’re in the directory, type the following command in the terminal `node index.js`

This will execute the JavaScript code in the index.js file, and the output `Hello, World!` will be displayed in the terminal.
