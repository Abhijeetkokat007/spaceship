NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows running JavaScript outside of a Web Browser.

```js
(Frontend) => Browser;
(Backend) => Server(NodeJS);
```

NodeJS is a server-side JavaScript runtime built on top of the **V8** JavaScript engine.

NodeJS allows us to run JavaScript code outside of Web Browsers and perform server-side tasks.

NodeJS is written in **C and C++** and provides a foundation for building fast and scalable network applications.
