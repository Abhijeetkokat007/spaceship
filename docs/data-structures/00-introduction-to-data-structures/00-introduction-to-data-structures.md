## What is Data Structure ?

Data Structure is organizing data in a specific way so that searching, sorting, storing and processing operation becomes fast & memory. 

## Why you should learn it?

Learning about data structures is important for several reasons. 

1. Data Structure is helps you to write more efficient and optimized code, as choosing the right data structure can greatly improve the performance of your code.

2. Knowledge of data structures is essential for interviews and technical assessments in the field of computer science and software development.

3. DSA helps you become a better problem solver. It teaches you how to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable sub-problems
