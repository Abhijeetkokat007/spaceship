## Range function

```python   
range(start, stop, step)
```

## Range ()
 To Genreate range of numbers.

**Syntax:**
 ```python
 range(start, stop, step)
```
**Start :**

An integer number specifying at which position to start. Default is 0

**Stop :**

An integer number specifying at which position to stop.

**step :**

An integer number specifying the incrementation. Default is 1

**Examples:**
```python title="example 1"
MyNumber=range(10)
print(MyNumber)
```
**Output:**
>range(0, 10)

We can passed a one parameter so its range function decide this one parameter `stop` because starting and step parameter have already by default value that is `0` & `1`. but we can passed a one value then this is decide this value is `stop`.

```python title="example 2"
MyNumber=range(2,10)
print(MyNumber)
```
**Output:**
>range(2, 10)

We can passed a one parameter so its range function decide this one parameter `start` and `stop` values. because starting and step parameter have already define the value that is `2` & `10`.

```python title="example 3"
MyNumber=range(10,20,2)
print(MyNumber)
```
**Output:**
>range(10, 20, 2)

We can passed a one parameter so its range function decide this one parameter `start`, `end` and `stop` values. because starting and step parameter have already define the values that is `10`, `20` & `2`.

## Loops
In loops you can repeate n number of code and lines.
There are three types are: 
1. for loop
2. while

## For Loop 

For loops are used when you have a block of code which you want to repeat a fixed number of times.

**Syntax :**
```python
for var_name in range(10)
```

```python title="example 1"
print("Hello Student")
print("Hello Student")
print("Hello Student")
print("Hello Student")
print("Hello Student")
print("Hello Student")
print("Hello Student")
print("Hello Student")
print("Hello Student")
print("Hello Student")
```
**Output:**
>Hello Student<br/>
>Hello Student<br/>
>Hello Student<br/>
>Hello Student<br/>
>Hello Student<br/>
>Hello Student<br/>
>Hello Student<br/>
>Hello Student<br/>
>Hello Student<br/>
>Hello Student

```python title="example 2"
for i in range(5):
  print("Hello World !!")
```
**Output:**
>Hello World !!<br/>
>Hello World !!<br/>
>Hello World !!<br/>
>Hello World !!<br/>
>Hello World !!

The `for` statement initiates a loop that will repeat for a specified number of times, in this case, five times.

The `range(5)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4, which will be used by the `for` loop to control how many times the loop is executed.

The indented block of code following the `for` statement will be executed once for each value generated by the "range(5)" function. In this case, the block of code contains a single "print" statement that will output the message `Hello World !!`.


```python title="example 3"
for i in range(4):
  print(i," Hello Student")
```
**Output:**
>0  Hello Student<br/>
>1  Hello Student<br/>
>2  Hello Student<br/>
>3  Hello Student

The `for` statement initiates a loop that will repeat for a specified number of times, in this case, five times.

The `range(4)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 3, which will be used by the `for` loop to control how many times the loop is executed.

The indented block of code following the `for` statement will be executed once for each value generated by the "range(4)" function. In this case, the block of code contains a single "print" statement that will output the message `Hello Student`.

```python title="example 4"
n = int(input("How many time do you print :"))
for i in range(n):
  print(i," Hello world")
```
**Output:**
>How many time do you print :5<br/>
>0  Hello world<br/>
>1  Hello world<br/>
>2  Hello world<br/>
>3  Hello world<br/>
>4  Hello world

In the above example, we are taking a input from user.The `for` statement initiates a loop that will repeat for a specified number of times, in this case, `n` times.

The `range(n)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to n, which will be used by the `for` loop to control how many times the loop is executed.

The indented block of code following the `for` statement will be executed once for each value generated by the `range(n)` function. In this case, the block of code contains a single "print" statement that will output the message `Hello world`.

```python title="example 5"
for i in range(5,7):
  print("This is task-1")
  print("This is task-2")
```
**Output:**
>This is task-1<br/>
>This is task-2<br/>
>This is task-1<br/>
>This is task-2


```python title="example 6"
for i in range(5, 55, 5):
  print(i)
```
**Output:**
>5<br/>
>10<br/>
>15<br/>
>20<br/>
>25<br/>
>30<br/>
>35<br/>
>40<br/>
>45<br/>
>50

The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers from the starting point `5` up to, but not including, the ending point `55`, incrementing by the step value `5` on each iteration of the loop.

So, in each iteration of the loop, the value of `i` will be incremented by `5`, and the loop will print the value of `i`. The loop will run `10` times, printing the values `5`, `10`, `15`, `20`, `25`, `30`, `35`, `40`, `45`, and `50`.

```python title="example 7"
n = int(input("Enter n :"))
for i in range(0,n,2):
  print(i)
```
**Output:**
>Enter n :10<br/>
>0<br/>
>2<br/>
>4<br/>
>6<br/>
>8

In the above example, we are taking a input from user.The `for` statement initiates a loop that will repeat for a specified number of times, in this case, `n` number of times.

The `range(0, n, 2)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to n, and increse the value from `2` which will be used by the `for` loop to control `n` number of value times the loop is executed.

```python title="example 8"
for i in range(5):
  print(i, "copying adhar card")
```
**Output:**
>0 copying adhar card<br/>
>1 copying adhar card<br/>
>2 copying adhar card<br/>
>3 copying adhar card<br/>
>4 copying adhar card<br/>

The `for` statement initiates a loop that will repeat for a specified number of times, in this case, five times.

The `range(5)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4, which will be used by the `for` loop to control how many times the loop is executed.

The indented block of code following the `for` statement will be executed once for each value generated by the `range(5)` function. In this case, the block of code contains a single "print" statement that will output the message  `i copying adhar card`.


```python title="example 9"
num = int(input("Enter n :"))
for i in range(num):
  if i%2==0:
    print(i)
```
**Output:**
>Enter n :10<br/>
>0<br/>
>2<br/>
>4<br/>
>6<br/>
>8

In the above example, we are taking a input from user.The `for` statement initiates a loop that will repeat for a specified number of times, in this case, `n` number of times.

The `range(num)` function generates a sequence of numbers from `0 to num`, then we are applying here `if condition` this condition is true then print `i` or `even number`.

## Break & Continue Keyword

```python title="example 10"
for val in range(10):
  if val == 2:
    break
  print(val)
```
**Output:**
>0
>1

The `for` statement initiates a loop that will repeat for a specified number of times, in this case, ten times.

The `range(10)` function generates a sequence of numbers from `0 to 9`, we are applying `if condition` "if val == 2" then we will use `break` keyword for break the loop. so output is only print `0 & 1`.

```python title="example 11"
for val in range(10):
  if val == 2:
    continue
  print(val)
```
**Output:**
>0<br/>
>1<br/>
>3<br/>
>4<br/>
>5<br/>
>6<br/>
>7<br/>
>8<br/>
>9

In the above example, The `for` statement initiates a loop that will repeat for a specified number of times, in this case, ten times.

The `range(10)` function generates a sequence of numbers from `0 to 9`, we are applying `if condition` "if val == 2" then we will use `continue` keyword for `skip` the specific number of the loop. so output is only print `0,1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9`.

## else keyword in python

```python title="example 12"
for i in range(10):
  print(i)
else:
  print("Loop executed successfully!!")
```
**Output:**
>0<br/>
>1<br/>
>2<br/>
>3<br/>
>4<br/>
>5<br/>
>6<br/>
>7<br/>
>8<br/>
>9<br/>
>Loop executed successfully!!

In the above example, The `for` statement initiates a loop that will repeat for a specified number of times, in this case, ten times.

The `range(10)` function generates a sequence of numbers from `0 to 9`.then print the value of `i` so output is print `0 to 9` and also print `else statement` that is `Loop executed successfully!!`.

```python title="example 13"
for i in range(5):
  if i == 2:
    break
  print(i)
else:
  print("Loop executed successfully!!")
```
**Output:**
>0<br/>
>1

The `for` statement initiates a loop that will repeat for a specified number of times, in this case, five times.

The `range(5)` function generates a sequence of numbers from `0 to 4`, we are applying `if else condition` "if val == 2" then we will use `break` keyword for break the loop. so output is only print `0 & 1`.

```python title="example 14"
for i in range(5):
  if i == 2:
    continue
  print(i)
  else:
  print("Loop executed successfully!!")
```
**Output:**
>0<br/>
>1<br/>
>3<br/>
>4<br/>
>Loop executed successfully!!

In the above example, The `for` statement initiates a loop that will repeat for a specified number of times, in this case, five times.

The `range(5)` function generates a sequence of numbers from `0 to 4`, we are applying `if else condition` then check the  condition "if val == 2" then we will use `continue` keyword for `skip` the specific number of the loop. then print the `i` number of values and then go to the `else` part and print `Loop executed successfully!!`.

```python title="example 15"
number  = int(input("Please enter any Number :"))
fact = 1

for i in range(1, number+1):
  fact = fact * i
print(fact)
```
**Output:**
>Please enter any Number :5<br/>
>120

In the above example, we are taking a input from user and stored in the number variable in second line we are created `fact = 1`. 

The `for` statement initiates a loop that will repeat for a specified number of times, in this case, n number of times we are passesd in the range starting from `1` & stop point `number + 1`. Again we are stored in the fact variable `fact * i` and print `fact`.

```python title="example 16"
students = ["Dhanashri", "Sahil","Rahul","Chaitali"]
for student in students:
  print("Sending mail to..",student)
```
**Output:**
>Sending mail to.. Dhanashri<br/>
>Sending mail to.. Sahil<br/>
>Sending mail to.. Rahul<br/>
>Sending mail to.. Chaital<br/>

In the above example we are create one `students` list and stored multiple data in their list,here apply for loop in this loop create one variable `student` and pass `students` list then finally we are print `student` name. so,output print for each student name of the students list.

```python title="example 17"
marks  = [90, 80, 70, 56, 78]
sum = 0
for mark in marks:
  sum = sum + mark
print(sum)
```
**Output:**
>374

In the above axample, we are declare one marks variable and stored different marks. create `sum` variable and its value is 0, here apply for loop in this loop create one variable `mark` and pass `marks` list.

Again create `sum` variable and stored in the `sum` variable addition of previous `sum` variable and `marks`. In the last we are print `sum`.

```python title="example 18"
tuple1 = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
for tup in tuple1:
  print(tup)
```
**Output:**
>10<br/>
>20<br/>
>30<br/>
>40<br/>
>50

In the above example, we are create one tuple that is `tuple1` storing differnt multiple data in that. Here apply for loop in this loop create `tup` variable and pass `tuple1` tuple then print this `tup`.

```python title="example 19"
courses = {
    "c": 499,
    "c++": 499,
    "python": 499,
    "icp":999,
    "dsa": 999
}

for i in courses.keys():
  print(i)
```
**Output:**
>c<br/>
>c++<br/>
>python<br/>
>icp<br/>
>dsa

In the above example, create one dictionary that is `courses` here we are use for loop in this loop create `i` variable and pass `courses.keys`. then print `i` variable so, we get all `keys` of `courses` dictionary.

```python title="example 20"
courses = {
    "c": 499,
    "c++": 499,
    "python": 499,
    "icp":999,
    "dsa": 999
}

for i in courses.values():
  print(i)
```
**Output:**
>499<br/>
>499<br/>
>499<br/>
>999<br/>
>999

In the above example, create one dictionary that is `courses` here we are use for loop in this loop create `i` variable and pass `courses.values`. then print `i` variable so, we get all `values` of `courses` dictionary.

```python title="example 21"
progress = {
    "vedika": 90,
    "Aniket": 91,
    "pranali": 93,
    "Prajakta": 94
}

for k,v in progress.items():
  print(k,"scored",v,"marks")
```
**Output:**
>vedika scored 90 marks<br/>
>Aniket scored 91 marks<br/>
>pranali scored 93 marks<br/>
>Prajakta scored 94 marks
