<details>
<summary>1. What is MongoDB?</summary>
<p>

MongoDB is a popular `NoSQL` database system that provides high scalability, flexibility, and performance for managing large amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data.

</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>2. What are the different databases available in MongoDB?</summary>
<p>

In MongoDB, there are three main databases: `admin`, `local`, and user-defined databases.

1. **admin**: The `admin` database is responsible for managing the MongoDB instance. It handles administrative tasks such as user management, authentication, and authorization.

2. **local**: The `local` database is used for internal purposes and stores data related to the MongoDB instance itself. It holds replica set metadata, keeps track of the local instance's configuration, and stores other temporary and transient data.

3. **User-defined databases**: MongoDB allows you to create user-defined databases based on your application's needs. These databases are created implicitly when the first document is inserted into a collection within that database.

For example, if you want to create a database called `mydb` to store data for a specific application, you can switch to it using the following command:

```
use mydb
```

This command creates the `mydb` database if it doesn't exist and switches to it. Once you have switched to a specific database, you can create collections within that database to organize and store your data.

</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>3. What is the concept of a document in MongoDB?</summary>
<p>

A document in MongoDB is a set of `key-value` pairs. It is equivalent to a record or row in a relational database.

For Example,

```js
{
  {
    name: "Yogita",
    age: 21
  },
  {
    name: "Harshada",
    age: 22
  }
}
```

In this example, we have a documents with two embedded documents. Each document represent a person with their respective name and age field.

These examples showcase the basic structure of BSON documents and how key-value pairs are used to represent data in MongoDB. BSON's flexibility and efficient encoding make it suitable for storing and retrieving data in MongoDB, providing a powerful and scalable solution for managing unstructured and semi-structured data.

</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>4. What is the meaning of a collection in MongoDB?</summary>
<p>

A collection is a group of related documents. It is the equivalent of a table in a relational database system. Collections in MongoDB are schema-less, meaning each document within a collection can have its own unique structure, unlike traditional tables where rows must adhere to a fixed schema.

Here is an example of creating a collection and inserting documents into it using the MongoDB shell:

1. Switch to the desired database:

   ```
   use mydb
   ```

2. Create a collection called "customers":

   ```
   db.createCollection("customers")
   ```

3. Insert documents into the "customers" collection:

   ```js
   db.customers.insertOne({ name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com" });
   db.customers.insertOne({
     name: "Jane Smith",
     email: "jane@example.com",
     age: 30,
   });
   ```

In this example, we switch to the "mydb" database, create a collection called "customers" using the `createCollection()` method, and then insert two documents into the "customers" collection using the `insertOne()` method.

</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>5. What is BSON in MongoDB?</summary>
<p>

BSON stands for Binary JSON. BSON is designed to be a more efficient and compact format for storing and transmitting data than plain text JSON.

For Example,

```js
{
  name: "Yogita",
  age: 21,
  city: "Ahemdnagar"
}
```

In the above Example,the document has three fields name, age, city. Each field has corresponding value.

</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>6. What is the purpose of BSON in MongoDB, and how can BSON values be stored in the database?</summary>
<p>

The purpose of BSON in MongoDB is to provide a compact and efficient way to represent and store data. It extends the JSON format by adding additional data types and binary encoding, which enables efficient serialization and deserialization of data. BSON supports various data types such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, dates, binary data, and more.

Example of storing BSON values in MongoDB using the MongoDB shell:

```JS
use mydb

db.myCollection.insertOne({
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 30,
  isActive: true,
  hobbies: ["reading", "gaming"],
  createdAt: new Date()
})
```

In this example, we switch to the `mydb` database, insert a document into the `myCollection` collection. The document contains various BSON values, such as a string `name`, a number `age`, a boolean `isActive`, an array of strings `hobbies`, and a date `createdAt`.

<summary>14. Which command is used to drop the database from MongoDB?</summary>
<p>

In MongoDB, the `db.dropDatabase()` command is used to drop or delete a database. This command deletes the entire database, including all the collections and their associated data.

To drop a database using the MongoDB shell, follow these steps:

1. Open the MongoDB shell by running the `mongo` command in your terminal or command prompt.

2. Switch to the database you want to drop using the `use` command. For example, to switch to a database called "mydb", you would run:

   ```
   use mydb
   ```

3. Once you are in the desired database, run the `db.dropDatabase()` command to drop the database:

   ```
   db.dropDatabase()
   ```

   After executing this command, MongoDB will drop the current database, including all its collections and data. Please be cautious when running this command, as it cannot be undone and the data will be permanently deleted.

In MongoDB, the `db` command is used to access and interact with a specific database in the MongoDB shell. It allows you to switch to a specific database and perform operations within that database.

The `db` command serves several purposes:

1. **Switching Databases**: By running `use <databaseName>`, the `db` command allows you to switch to the specified database. For example, to switch to a database called "mydb", you would run:

   ```
   use mydb
   ```

   Once you switch to a specific database, all subsequent operations will be performed within that database.

2. **Accessing Collections**: After switching to a database, you can use the `db` command to access collections within that database. For example, if you are in the "mydb" database and want to access a collection called "users", you can use:

   ```
   db.users
   ```

   This allows you to perform various operations on the "users" collection, such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting documents.

3. **Executing Database Commands**: The `db` command also enables you to execute various database-level commands specific to the current database. These commands are usually prefixed with `db.`. For example, you can use `db.stats()` to retrieve statistics about the current database, or `db.dropDatabase()` to delete the current database.
