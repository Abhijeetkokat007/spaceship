## Conditional Statements

 A conditional statement is a programming construct that allows you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a certain condition is true or false. 

### 1. if

 **Syntax**

 ```js
if(condition)
{
    //statement
}
 ```

 **Code**

 ```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      const age = 20;

	  if(age>18)
	  {
		document.write("You are eligible for voting...")
	  }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
 ```

 **Output**

 >You are eligible for voting...

 In the above program value `20` to the variable `age`, and then checks if `age` is greater than `18` using an if statement. If the condition is `true`, the code inside the block is executed, which in this case is a call to the `document.write()` function to display the message `"You are eligible for voting..."` on the web page.

 ### 2. if-else

 **Syntax**

 ```js
if(condition)
{
    //statement
}
else
{
    //statement
}
 ```

**Code**

 ```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      const age = 16;

	  if(age>18)
	  {
		document.write("You are eligible for voting...")
	  }
	  else
	  {
		document.write("You are not eligible for voting...")
	  }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
 ```

 **Output**

>You are not eligible for voting...

In this program, the age is assigned to a constant variable `age` with the value of `16`. The if statement checks if the `age is greater than 18`. If the condition is `true`, it will execute the `document.write()` statement with the message `You are eligible for voting...`. If the condition is `false`, it will execute the else block with the message `You are not eligible for voting...`.

Since the `age` value in this case is `16`, which is less than `18`, the output of the program would be `You are not eligible for voting...`


**Program : Use if-else and write JS program to check if given number is positive or negative.**

**Code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
     const num = parseInt(prompt("Enter any Number: "));

	 if(num<0)
	 {
		document.write("Negative Number");
	 }
	 else
	 {
		document.write("Positive Number")
	 }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

 ### 2. if-else-ladder

 **Syntax**

 ```js
if(condition A)
{
    //statement
}
else if (condition B)
{
    //statement
}
else if (condition C)
{
    //statement
}
else
{
  //statement
}
 ```

**Code**

 ```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello JS ðŸ’›</title>
    <script>
      const num = 1;

	  if(num==1)
	  {
		document.write("One")
	  }
	  else if(num==2)
	  {
		document.write("Two")
	  }
    else if(num==3)
    {
    document.write("Three")
    }
    else
    {
      document.write("Not Match")
    }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
 ```

 **Output**

>One

This code will output `One` because the value of the variable `num` is `1` and the first if statement checks if `num` is equal to `1`. Since this condition is `true`, the code inside the first if statement will execute, which is to write `One` to the document.

If the value of `num` were `2`, the second else if statement would execute and the code would write `Two` to the document. Similarly, if `num` were `3`, the third else if statement would execute and the code would write `Three` to the document. If the value of `num` were anything other than 1, 2, or 3, the else statement would execute and the code would write `Wrong input` to the document.
