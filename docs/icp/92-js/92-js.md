  <summary>1. What is JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
  
JavaScript is a dynamic programming language, a scripting language used to develop web applications, games, and more. It allows us to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot do with just HTML and CSS.

  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>2. Is JavaScript is case sensitive? Explain its example.</summary>

  <p>
  
 Yes , For Ex. Variable names are case-sensitive, which means "name" and "Name" are considered different variables.
  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>3. What are the features of JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
  
  1. High-Level Language <br/>
  2. Interpreted Language <br/>
  3. Asynchronous Programming <br/>
  4. DOM Manipulation

  </p>

</details>

<details>
    <summary>4. What is let keyword in javascript?</summary>
  <p>
   
1. Let keyword used to declare variables in JavaScript. <br/>

```html
<script>
  let age = 20;
  console.log(age);
</script>
```

In the above example, the `let` is used to declare variable `age`.

2. Variables defined using let Cannot be re-declared within the same scope.

```html
<script>
  let age = 20;
  console.log(age);
  let age = 30;
  console.log(age);
</script>

output : Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'age' has already been declared
```

In the above example, the `age` is used to re-declare in same scope. so it show the error massage .

  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>5. What is the console.log() function in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
  
 1. Debugging: You can use it to print variable values, intermediate results, or the flow of your program to the console. This helps you identify and fix issues in your code.
 <br/>
   2. Inspecting Data: You can log the contents of variables, arrays, objects, or any JavaScript data type to examine their values and structures.
  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>6. What is the use of the alert() function in JavaScript?
</summary>

  <p>
  
 The alert() function is a built-in JavaScript function that displays a simple dialog box or popup in the user's web browser with a specified message. This message is often used to convey important information, warnings, or prompts to the user. The user needs to acknowledge the alert by clicking the `OK`` button before they can continue interacting with the web page.
  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary> 7. How do you add JavaScript in html element?</summary>

  <p>
 
 You can Add JavaScript in Html elements using script tag.

```html
<script></script>
```

  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>8. How do you declare a variable in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
     In JavaScript , you can declare a variable using one of three keywords `var` `let` and `const`. The choice of which keyword to use depends on the variable's intended scope and whether it should be changeable or constant .
  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>9. What is the difference between let, var and const keyword in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>

## Difference between var, let and const

### var

- The scope of the var variable is the functional scope.

- It can be updated and re-declared in scope.

- It can be declared without initialization.

- It can be accessed without initialization because its default value is undefined.

### let

- Let allow us to declare a variable that is limited to the scope of a block.

- In let first we declare variable and second time we used so there is no need to write second time.

- It can be declared without initialization.

- It cannot accessed without initialization, or a "reference error" will be raised.

### const

- The scope of the const variable is block scope.

- It cannot be updated or re-declared in scope.

- It cannot be accessed without initialization because it cannot be declared without initialization.

</p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary> 10. How do you check the type of a variable in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
  
  You can check the type of a variable in JavaScript using the `typeof` operator. The typeof operator returns a string that represents the data type of the operand.

```js
let variable = 42;
console.log(typeof variable); // Output: "number"

let text = "Hello, world!";
console.log(typeof text); // Output: "string"

let isTrue = true;
console.log(typeof isTrue); // Output: "boolean"

let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
console.log(typeof fruits); // Output: "object"
```

  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>11. Is it possible to break JavaScript Code into several lines?
</summary>

  <p>
  "Yes, it's completely possible and often a good idea to divide your JavaScript code into multiple lines. This is done to make your code easier to read and maintain. JavaScript is quite forgiving when it comes to adding line breaks and spaces, so you can structure your code to make it more clear and understandable." 
  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>12. What is the use of confirm() function in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
  
 The confirm() function in JavaScript is used to show a pop-up dialog box that asks the user to confirm or cancel an action. It's often used to get the user's consent before proceeding with a certain operation, like deleting a file or submitting a form.
  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>13. What is the purpose of prompt() function in JavaScript?
</summary>

  <p>
  
 prompt() are used to take input from user. in prompt we pass one message that message show in prompt popup.
 </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>14. What is an operator and what are their types in Javascript?</summary>

  <p>
  
 Operators are used to perform certain operations on one or more values or variables. <br/> <br/>

Some common types of operators :

> 1. Arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, /). <br/>
> 2. Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, \*=, /=) <br/>
> 3. Increment & Decrement operators <br/>
> 4. Comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=) <br/>
> 5. Logical operators (&& (logical AND), || (logical OR), ! (logical NOT)) <br/>

</p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>15. What is a ternary operator?</summary>

  <p>
  
 The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, It's easy way to write simple conditional expressions. It provides a concise way to evaluate a condition and return one of two values based on whether the condition is true or false. <br/> <br/>
 Syntax :

```js
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
```

</p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>16. What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
  
 The difference between the == and === operator in javascript is that the == operator does the type conversion of the operands before comparison, whereas the === operator compares the values as well as the data types of the operands.
  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>17. Explain the conditional statments in JavaScript.</summary>

  <p>
  
1. The if/else statement is a JavaScript conditional statement that executes a block of code if a specified        condition is true, and if the condition is false, another block of code can be executed. <br/>
2. This statement is part of JavaScript's "Conditional" Statements, which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions

  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>18. How do you take input from users in JavaScript?
</summary>

  <p>
  
To take input from users in JavaScript, you can use the prompt() function. <br/>
For Ex.

```js
let input = prompt("Please enter something:");
console.log("User entered: " + input);
```

</p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary> 19. What happens if you forget to include a break statement in a switch case?</summary>

  <p>
  
If you forget to include a break statement in a switch case in JavaScript, the code will continue to execute subsequent case statements .

```js
let fruit = "apple";
switch (fruit) {
 case "apple":
   console.log("It's an apple.");
 // No break statement
 case "banana":
   console.log("It's a banana.");
   break;
 case "cherry":
   console.log("It's a cherry.");
   break;
 default:
   console.log("It's something else.");
   break;
}

Output : It's an apple.
It's a banana.

```

In above example notice that after the first matching case ("apple"), it continues to execute the code in the next case ("banana") because there is no break statement between them. It only stops when it encounters a break statement or reaches the end of the switch statement.

  </p>

  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>22. What is the syntax of a switch statement in JavaScript?</summary>

<p> Syntax

```js
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // Code to be executed if expression matches value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // Code to be executed if expression matches value2
    break;
  case value3:
    // Code to be executed if expression matches value3
    break;
  default:
    // Code to be executed if expression doesn't match any of the values
    break;

</details>

 <details>
  <summary>23. What are the different data types in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>### 1. String

A string is a data type used to represent textual data. It consists of a sequence of characters enclosed within single ('') or double ("") quotation marks.

Example :

"Hello, I'm a string"

'Hello, How are you...'

### 2. Int

Integers are whole numbers without decimal points.

Example :

123456

### 3. Float

Floats are numbers with decimal points.

8793.90

### 4. Boolean

A boolean represents one of two possible values: true or false.

true or false

  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>24. What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
  
 1. undefined:

undefined represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned any value yet. It is also the default value of function parameters that are not provided when a function is called.

```js
let x;
console.log(x); // undefined
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
}
greet(); // Hello, undefined
```

> 2.  null

null is a deliberate assignment to a variable or property indicating the absence of any object value. It represents an intentional absence of any object value or a "no value" value.

```js
let y = null;
console.log(y); // null
```

</p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>25.What is a string in JavaScript??</summary>

  <p>
  
In JavaScript, a string is a data type used to represent a sequence of characters, such as text. Strings are one of the fundamental data types in JavaScript, and they are used extensively for working with textual data.

  </p>

</details>

 <details>
  <summary>26.What are the pop-up boxes in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
  
      In JavaScript, pop-up boxes are dialog boxes or windows that are displayed on the user's screen to interact with them or provide information.
  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>27. Can you explain what a switch statement is and how it is used in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
  
A switch statement is a control structure in JavaScript (and many other programming languages) that allows you to evaluate a variable or expression against multiple possible case values. It provides a way to execute different blocks of code based on the value of the variable or expression.<br/><br/>
    Here's how a switch statement works : <br/><br/>
1. The expression is evaluated, and its value is compared to each case value sequentially.

2. If a case value matches the expression, the code block associated with that case is executed. The break statement is used to exit the switch statement after executing the code for the matched case.

3. If none of the case values match the expression, the code block under the default label (if present) is executed. The default case is optional, and it serves as a fallback when no other cases match.

</p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>28. What is function in JavaScript? Explain its types.</summary>

  <p>
  
A function in JavaScript is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called or executed multiple times.

Function code block which can be reused to perform a specific task.

> ### 1. Inbuilt
>
> In JavaScript, inbuilt functions already have predefined meanings for various tasks. This means that the meaning is already defined and known to JavaScript.

Example :

alert() : An alert box will be displayed that contains a message along with an OK button.<br/>
prompt() :A prompt box displays an additional input field for the user to provide a value for output.<br/>
console.log() : You can use the browser console to display messages or values.<br/>
parseInt() : Converts a string into an Integer.<br/>
parseFloat() : Converts a string into a Floating-point number.

### 2. User Define

By using the function keyword, to create and define your own functions known as user-defined functions.<br/>
Syntax :

```js
function <function-name> ()
{
    // Block of Code
}
```

  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>29. What is an arrow function in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
  
  Arrow functions are a shorter way to write functions in JavaScript. They are especially handy for small, simple functions.<br/>
   syntax : <br/>
   ```js
   const variableName = (paameters) => {
  // function code
};
```

   </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>30. How do you pass arguments to a function?</summary>

  <p>
      In JavaScript, you can pass arguments to a function when you call it. Arguments are values or expressions that you provide to the function, and the function can use these arguments to perform some actions or calculations.
