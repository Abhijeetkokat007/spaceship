  <summary>1. What is JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
  
JavaScript is a dynamic programming language, a scripting language used to develop web applications, games, and more. It allows us to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot do with just HTML and CSS.

  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>2. Is JavaScript is case sensitive? Explain its example.</summary>

  <p>
  
 Yes , For Ex. Variable names are case-sensitive, which means "name" and "Name" are considered different variables.
  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>3. What are the features of JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
  
  1. High-Level Language <br/>
  2. Interpreted Language <br/>
  3. Asynchronous Programming <br/>
  4. DOM Manipulation

  </p>

</details>

    <summary>4. What is let keyword in javascript?</summary>
  <p>
   
1. Let keyword used to declare variables in JavaScript. <br/>

```html
<script>
  let age = 20;
  console.log(age);
</script>
```

In the above example, the `let` is used to declare variable `age`.

2. Variables defined using let Cannot be re-declared within the same scope.

```html
<script>
  let age = 20;
  console.log(age);
  let age = 30;
  console.log(age);
</script>

output : Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'age' has already been declared
```

In the above example, the `age` is used to re-declare in same scope. so it show the error massage .

  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>5. What is the console.log() function in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
  
 1. Debugging: You can use it to print variable values, intermediate results, or the flow of your program to the console. This helps you identify and fix issues in your code.
 <br/>
   2. Inspecting Data: You can log the contents of variables, arrays, objects, or any JavaScript data type to examine their values and structures.
  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>6. What is the use of the alert() function in JavaScript?
</summary>

  <p>
  
 The alert() function is a built-in JavaScript function that displays a simple dialog box or popup in the user's web browser with a specified message. This message is often used to convey important information, warnings, or prompts to the user.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>8. How do you declare a variable in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
     In JavaScript , you can declare a variable using one of three keywords `var` `let` and `const`. The choice of which keyword to use depends on the variable's intended scope and whether it should be changeable or constant .
  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>9. What is the difference between let, var and const keyword in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>

## Difference between var, let and const

### var

- The scope of the var variable is the functional scope.

- It can be updated and re-declared in scope.

- It can be declared without initialization.

- It can be accessed without initialization because its default value is undefined.

### let

- Let allow us to declare a variable that is limited to the scope of a block.

- In let first we declare variable and second time we used so there is no need to write second time.

- It can be declared without initialization.

- It cannot accessed without initialization, or a "reference error" will be raised.

### const

- The scope of the const variable is block scope.

- It cannot be updated or re-declared in scope.

- It cannot be accessed without initialization because it cannot be declared without initialization.

</p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary> 10. How do you check the type of a variable in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
  
  You can check the type of a variable in JavaScript using the `typeof` operator. The typeof operator returns a string that represents the data type of the operand.

```js
let variable = 42;
console.log(typeof variable); // Output: "number"

let text = "Hello, world!";
console.log(typeof text); // Output: "string"

let isTrue = true;
console.log(typeof isTrue); // Output: "boolean"

let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
console.log(typeof fruits); // Output: "object"
```

  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>11. Is it possible to break JavaScript Code into several lines?
</summary>

  <p>
  "Yes, it's completely possible and often a good idea to divide your JavaScript code into multiple lines. This is done to make your code easier to read and maintain. JavaScript is quite forgiving when it comes to adding line breaks and spaces, so you can structure your code to make it more clear and understandable." 
  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>12. What is the use of confirm() function in JavaScript?</summary>

</p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>15. What is a ternary operator?</summary>

  <p>
  
 The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, It's easy way to write simple conditional expressions. It provides a concise way to evaluate a condition and return one of two values based on whether the condition is true or false. <br/> <br/>
 Syntax :

```js
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
```

</p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>16. What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
  
 The difference between the == and === operator in javascript is that the == operator does the type conversion of the operands before comparison, whereas the === operator compares the values as well as the data types of the operands.
  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>17. Explain the conditional statments in JavaScript.</summary>

  <p>
  
1. The if/else statement is a JavaScript conditional statement that executes a block of code if a specified        condition is true, and if the condition is false, another block of code can be executed. <br/>
2. This statement is part of JavaScript's "Conditional" Statements, which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions

  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>18. How do you take input from users in JavaScript?
</summary>

  <p>
  
To take input from users in JavaScript, you can use the prompt() function. <br/>
For Ex.

```js
let input = prompt("Please enter something:");
console.log("User entered: " + input);
```

</p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary> 19. What happens if you forget to include a break statement in a switch case?</summary>

  <p>
  
If you forget to include a break statement in a switch case in JavaScript, the code will continue to execute subsequent case statements .

```js
let fruit = "apple";
switch (fruit) {
 case "apple":
   console.log("It's an apple.");
 // No break statement
 case "banana":
   console.log("It's a banana.");
   break;
 case "cherry":
   console.log("It's a cherry.");
   break;
 default:
   console.log("It's something else.");
   break;
}

Output : It's an apple.
It's a banana.

```

In above example notice that after the first matching case ("apple"), it continues to execute the code in the next case ("banana") because there is no break statement between them. It only stops when it encounters a break statement or reaches the end of the switch statement.

  <summary>24. What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
  
 1. undefined:

undefined represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned any value yet. It is also the default value of function parameters that are not provided when a function is called.

```js
let x;
console.log(x); // undefined
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
}
greet(); // Hello, undefined
```

> 2.  null

null is a deliberate assignment to a variable or property indicating the absence of any object value. It represents an intentional absence of any object value or a "no value" value.

```js
let y = null;
console.log(y); // null
```

</p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>27. Can you explain what a switch statement is and how it is used in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
  
A switch statement is a control structure in JavaScript (and many other programming languages) that allows you to evaluate a variable or expression against multiple possible case values. It provides a way to execute different blocks of code based on the value of the variable or expression.<br/><br/>
    Here's how a switch statement works : <br/><br/>
1. The expression is evaluated, and its value is compared to each case value sequentially.

2. If a case value matches the expression, the code block associated with that case is executed. The break statement is used to exit the switch statement after executing the code for the matched case.

3. If none of the case values match the expression, the code block under the default label (if present) is executed. The default case is optional, and it serves as a fallback when no other cases match.

</p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>28. What is function in JavaScript? Explain its types.</summary>

  <p>
  
A function in JavaScript is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called or executed multiple times.

Function code block which can be reused to perform a specific task.

> ### 1. Inbuilt
>
> In JavaScript, inbuilt functions already have predefined meanings for various tasks. This means that the meaning is already defined and known to JavaScript.

Example :

alert() : An alert box will be displayed that contains a message along with an OK button.<br/>
prompt() :A prompt box displays an additional input field for the user to provide a value for output.<br/>
console.log() : You can use the browser console to display messages or values.<br/>
parseInt() : Converts a string into an Integer.<br/>
parseFloat() : Converts a string into a Floating-point number.

### 2. User Define

By using the function keyword, to create and define your own functions known as user-defined functions.<br/>
Syntax :

```js
function <function-name> ()
{
    // Block of Code
}
```

  </p>

   ```js
   const variableName = (paameters) => {
  // function code
};
```

   </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>30. How do you pass arguments to a function?</summary>

  <p>

  <summary>32. What is break and continue statments in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
     In JavaScript, break and continue are control flow statements that are used in loops to alter the flow of execution. <br/>  <br/>
        1. break <br/>
         The break statement is used to exit (or "break out of") a loop prematurely. It is typically used within for, while, or do...while loops to terminate the loop's execution. <br/>
         When break is encountered, the loop in which it resides is immediately terminated, and program control moves to the first statement after the loop. <br/> <br/>
         2. continue  <br/>
         The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. <br/>
     It is often used when a certain condition is met, and you want to skip the current iteration but continue with the rest of the loop.

    1. Parameter: <br/> <br/>
    A parameter is a variable or a named placeholder in the function definition. It's a part of the function's signature, and it serves as a way to receive input data when the function is called.
    Parameters are defined in the function declaration and are enclosed in parentheses. They act as local variables within the function and represent the values that the function expects to receive when it's called.
    <br/> <br/>
    2. Argument: <br/> <br/>
    An argument is an actual value or expression that you pass to a function when you call it. These values are provided within the parentheses when invoking the function.

  <summary>50. What is loop in Javascript?</summary>

  <p>
  In JavaScript, a loop is a control structure that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code. Loops are essential for performing tasks like iterating over arrays, processing lists of data, and executing code multiple times until a certain condition is met.

  </p>

</details>

 <details>
  <summary>51. What are the different types of loops available in JavaScript?
</summary>

  <p>
   In JavaScript, there are several types of loops that are commonly used for iterating over data or executing a block of code repeatedly.<br/><br/>
   1. for loop: <br/> A standard loop that repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. This loop is often used when the number of iterations is known.
   <br/> <br/>
   2. while loop: <br/> This loop repeats as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. It is commonly used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand. <br/> <br/>
   3. do-while loop:  <br/> Similar to the while loop, but the code block is executed at least once before the condition is checked.


  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>52. What is the purpose of break keyword and continue keyword?</summary>

  <p>
  The break and continue keywords are used within loops to control the flow of the loop execution. <br/> <br/>
  1. Break : The break statement is used to immediately terminate a loop. When the break statement is encountered inside a loop.  <br/> <br/>
  2. continue: The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration.

  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary> 53. What is the difference between while and do-while loop?</summary>

  <p>
   1. while loop:<br/> In a while loop, the condition is evaluated before the execution of the loop's body. If the condition is false initially, the loop's body will never be executed.<br/><br/>
   2. Do-While: <br/> In a do-while loop, the condition is evaluated after the execution of the loop's body. This guarantees that the loop's body will execute at least once, even if the condition is initially false.

  </p>

<details>
  <summary>69. How do you handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
    1. Callbacks: You can use callbacks to handle asynchronous operations. Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed when the asynchronous operation is completed. However, nested callbacks can lead to callback hell, making the code difficult to read and maintain.<br/><br/> 
2. Promises: Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations. They represent a value that might be available now, or in the future, or never. Promises have a chainable syntax that allows you to attach callbacks for successful or failed completion of an asynchronous operation. They help avoid callback hell and make asynchronous code more readable. <br/> <br/>
 3. Async/await: Async/await is a modern syntax for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. Async functions enable you to write asynchronous code as if it were synchronous. The async keyword is used to define an asynchronous function, and the await keyword is used to pause the execution of the function until a promise is settled.<br/> <br/>

  <p>
   1. for: <br/>
   The for loop is the most commonly used loop in JavaScript. It iterates over a block of code a specific number of times.<br/><br/>
   2. while: <br/>
   In a while loop, the loop executes as long as the condition is true.
  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>91. What is an infinite loop, and how do you avoid it in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
   An infinite loop is a loop that runs indefinitely because its exit condition is never met or there is no exit condition specified. 
  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>92. How do you skip the current iteration and move to the next one in a loop?</summary>

  <p>
  you can use the continue statement to skip the current iteration and continue with the next iteration in a loop. This statement is typically used within loops, such as for loops, while loops, or do-while loops. When the continue statement is encountered, the remaining code within the loop for the current iteration is skipped, and the loop proceeds with the next iteration.
   
  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>93. How does the for loop work in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
  1. Initialization: Typically used to initialize the loop counter. It is executed only once before the loop starts.<br/>
2. Condition: The condition is evaluated before each iteration. If it evaluates to true, the loop continues. If it evaluates to false, the loop ends.<br/>
3. Inc/Dec: Executed at the end of each iteration. It can be used to update the loop counter or perform any other necessary actions.
  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>94. How does the while loop work in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>

  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>95. How does the do-while loop work in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>It has a similar purpose of executing a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. The key difference is that in a do-while loop, the condition is evaluated after the execution of the loop's body. This guarantees that the loop body is executed at least once, even if the condition is initially false.
   
  </p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>96. How do you break out of a loop in JavaScript?</summary>

  <p>
    you can use the break statement to immediately terminate a loop. When the break statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop stops its execution, and the program control moves to the statement immediately following the loop.<br/>

The break statement can be used with various types of loops such as for, while, and do-while loops. It is commonly used in conjunction with an if statement to terminate the loop when a certain condition is met.
