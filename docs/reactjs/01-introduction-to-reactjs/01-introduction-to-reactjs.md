## React 

React is a JavaScript frontend library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

2. Developed by facebook (meta).
3. Its provide component based development, create component once and use multiple times.
4. micro frontend
```

### Features of React JS

1. Fast
2. HMR (Hot Module Reloading)
3. Virtual DOM
4. JSX

**Hot Module Replacement (HMR):** It is a development feature that enables real-time updates of code changes in a running application, helping developers see immediate results without needing to refresh the entire page or application. It speeds up the development process and preserves the application's state while updating specific modules or components.

**Real DOM:** When you build a web application, the browser creates a Document Object Model (DOM) to represent the structure and content of your webpage. This DOM is a hierarchical tree-like structure consisting of HTML elements, their properties, and their relationships with each other. Manipulating the DOM directly is slow and can be resource-intensive.

**Virtual DOM:** The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM. It's essentially a copy of the real DOM, but it's not directly tied to the browser's rendering engine. Developers use frameworks like React to work with the Virtual DOM.

**JSX :** JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It's a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React to describe the structure and layout of user interfaces. JSX allows developers to write `HTML-like syntax which allows to write Hs & Html at one place`. making it easier to define and render UI components in React applications.

```js
npm -> node package manager
npx -> node package executer
