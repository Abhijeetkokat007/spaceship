## Why a Good Folder Structure Matters

Having a well-organized folder structure is crucial because it:

1. **Improves Maintainability**: Makes it easier to find and update code, reducing the risk of bugs and enhancing collaboration among team members.

2. **Simplifies Scalability**: Allows for easy expansion of your project with new features and components without confusion.

3. **Enhances Code Reusability**: Promotes the reuse of components, styles, and utilities throughout your application.

4. **Streamlines Debugging**: Helps pinpoint issues quickly by keeping related files together.

## Folder Structure

Here's a recommended folder structure for your React project:

```js
/src
  /components
  /views
```

1. `/components` Folder

The components folder is where you store reusable UI components that can be easily used across different views or pages in your React application. These components are designed for easy reuse throughout your application.

**Why Use It:**

**Reusability**: By centralizing reusable components in one place, you avoid duplicating code and ensure consistency in your UI elements. For example, you might have a Button component that can be used in multiple views without rewriting the same code.

**Maintainability**: When you keep components separate, it's easier to take care of them. If you fix or change something in a component, those changes automatically apply everywhere you use it. This helps prevent mistakes and keeps everything consistent.

**Organization**: It keeps your codebase organized and more modular, making it easier for you and your team to navigate and work on specific parts of the application.

**Examples of Components**:

```css
/src
  /components
    /Button
      Button.js
      Button.css
    /Navbar
      Navbar.js
      Navbar.css
    /Footer
      Footer.js
      Footer.css
```

2. `/views` Folder
This is where you store components and files that are unique to specific pages or sections of your app. Each page or section, like the home page or user profile, typically has its own folder in the `/views` directory.

**Why Use It:**

**Clarity**: Views have their own dedicated space, so you always know where to find their files. It's like having labeled drawers for different types of clothes.

**Special Style**: Views can have unique looks. For instance, the home page may look different from the dashboard. Storing style-related stuff in their respective view folders keeps things tidy.

```js
/src
  /views
    /Home
      Home.js
      Home.css
    /About
      About.js
      About.css
    /Contact
      Contact.js
      Contact.css
```
